# Eye Disease Classification

## Overview

**Eye Disease Classification** is a machine learning project aimed at detecting and classifying various eye diseases from retinal images using deep learning techniques. This tool assists ophthalmologists and healthcare professionals by providing preliminary automated diagnoses that can help prioritize patients for further examination.

## Features

- 📷 Upload and analyze retinal images
- 🧠 Efficient Net including with Swin transformers
- 🔍 Detects diseases such as:
  - Diabetic Retinopathy
  - Glaucoma
  - Cataract
  - Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
  - Normal retina
- 📊 Displays confidence scores for each prediction
- 💾 Model trained on publicly available datasets

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Dataset**: [EyePACS](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data), [ODIR](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir
